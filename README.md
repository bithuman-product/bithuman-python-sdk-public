# This repository has moved

The contents of `bithuman-product/bithuman-python-sdk-public` have been folded into
[`bithuman-product/bithuman-sdk-public`](https://github.com/bithuman-product/bithuman-sdk-public)
under `python/` as part of the 2026-05 GitHub org consolidation
(14 → 7 active repos).

The new repo holds: public Python SDK distribution metadata (CHANGELOG, LICENSE, README) — published wheels still come from PyPI as before, sourced from the private bithuman-python-sdk repo.

This repo is kept read-only for at least one quarter (until ~2026-08)
so old links and external references continue to resolve. After that
it will be formally archived.
